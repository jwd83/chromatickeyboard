# Chromatic Keyboard

**[🎹 Play it live!](https://jwd83.github.io/chromatickeyboard/)**

A web application that transforms your computer keyboard into a chromatic musical instrument. Upload any audio sample and play it across three octaves using your keyboard!

## Features

- 🎹 **Three Octave Range**: Play notes across C3 to B5
- 🎵 **Any Sound Sample**: Upload any audio file (.wav, .mp3, .ogg) as your instrument
- ⌨️ **Two Play Modes**:
  - **Scale Mode**: C major scale laid out across three QWERTY rows
  - **Chord Mode**: I–V–vi–IV progression ("four chord song") across multiple octaves
- 🔁 **Loop Recorder**: Record what you play and loop it hands-free
- 🎛️ **Multiple Voices**: Load several sound files and switch between them on the fly
- 📦 **Sample Export**: Download a ZIP of rendered WAV samples for the selected voice and mode
- 🔉 **Output Safety**: Per-note gain, optional fade-out, and a master limiter to tame clipping
- 👀 **Visual Feedback**: See which keys are active as you play
- 🎼 **Real-time Audio**: Low-latency playback using the Web Audio API

## How to Use

1. **Load a Sound File**: Click "Load Sound File" and select an audio file from your computer.
2. **Choose a Mode** using the **Mode** dropdown:
   - **Scale Mode** – play the C major scale across the rows
   - **Chord Mode** – trigger I–V–vi–IV chords instead of single notes
3. **Play the Keyboard** (C major scale layout in Scale Mode):
   - **Q W E R U I O P**: Octave Up (C5–C6)
   - **A S D F J K L ;**: Root Octave (C4–C5)
   - **Z X C V M , . /**: Octave Down (C3–C4)
4. **Tweak the Sound**:
   - Toggle **Fade Out Previous Notes** to choose between hard-cut and smoother transitions
   - The master limiter automatically reduces peaks when many notes/chords stack
5. **Manage Voices**:
   - Load multiple sounds using **Load Sound File**; each load adds a new voice
   - Use the **Voices** list to select the active voice or remove voices you no longer want
6. **Export Samples**:
   - Click **Export Sample Zip** to download rendered WAV files for every key in the current mode
   - In Scale Mode, the ZIP contains each note across the three keyboard rows
7. **Use the Loop Recorder**:
   - Click **Record**, play on the keyboard, then click **Stop Recording**
   - Click **Play Loop** to start looping; **Stop Loop** to stop; **Clear Loop** to erase
   - Loops remember which mode, voice, and fade-out setting were used when they were recorded

## Keyboard Layout

```
q  w  e  r     u  i  o  p    <- Octave Up (C5)
C  D  E  F     G  A  B  C

a  s  d  f     j  k  l  ;    <- Root Octave (C4)
C  D  E  F     G  A  B  C

z  x  c  v     m  ,  .  /    <- Octave Down (C3)
C  D  E  F     G  A  B  C
```

## Technical Details

- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Audio Engine**: Web Audio API for audio decoding, pitch shifting, and mixing
- **Pitch Shifting**: Uses playback rate manipulation (2^(semitones/12))
- **Chords**: Each chord is built from the same sample using per-note playback rate and reduced per-note gain
- **Sample Export**: Uses `OfflineAudioContext` to render each key to WAV, then packages the files with a dependency-free ZIP writer
- **Master Limiter**: Global gain + `DynamicsCompressorNode` reduce clipping when many sources play at once
- **Loop Recorder**: Captures key events with timestamps and replays them in a timed loop

## Local Development

Simply open `index.html` in a modern web browser. No build process or dependencies required!

## Deployment to GitHub Pages

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Push your code:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/chromatickeyboard.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
3. Enable GitHub Pages:
   - Go to repository Settings → Pages
   - Under "Source", select "main" branch
   - Click Save
4. Your app will be live at: `https://yourusername.github.io/chromatickeyboard/`

## Browser Compatibility

Works in all modern browsers that support the Web Audio API:
- Chrome/Edge (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Opera

## Limitations

- Pitch shifting via playback rate changes both pitch and duration (chipmunk effect for higher notes)
- Latency may vary depending on browser and system performance
- The master limiter helps, but extreme input levels or many overlapping notes can still pump or distort slightly

## Future Enhancements

- ADSR envelope controls
- Multiple sample support
- MIDI keyboard support
- Performance recording and export
- Advanced pitch shifting algorithms
